## Abstract

Our daily lives are a continuous stream of sensory information. Yet when we recall those experiences later, we usually remember our past experiences as a sequence of discretized events. Although recent studies have investigated the causes and consequences of event segmentation using naturalistic stimuli such as movies, little is known about the event segmentation processes for real-world events on a longer timescale (e.g., days, months, years). Here, by combining behavioral data and text analysis, we investigated how people remember long-lasting real-world experiences and attempted to extend the event segmentation research into real-world events outside of the laboratory. Specifically, we explored event boundaries for a series of events related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that lasted several months and investigated whether self-reported event boundaries are related to media coverage, the main source of information about these events. Participants were instructed to annotate the event boundaries where they felt a new phase had begun, looking at headlines by date and recalling a series of COVID-19-related events in the past six months. We first tested whether there were common event boundaries in memory among participants, and found that there was a significant agreement among the participants at a total of six time points. Next, to test whether these event boundaries in memory were related to the temporal patterns of topics in media coverage over the past six months, we collected 67,089 articles on COVID-19 that were reported from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020. We then represented each article as a weighted sum of 100 topics by applying topic modeling to the entire set of articles, and segmented the topic time series into discrete events using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We found that participantsâ€™ behavioral event boundaries in memory and data-driven HMM boundaries in news topics were significantly matched. These findings suggest that shared event boundaries in memory can be formed among different people, and that these boundaries are related to the temporal patterns of media coverage.
