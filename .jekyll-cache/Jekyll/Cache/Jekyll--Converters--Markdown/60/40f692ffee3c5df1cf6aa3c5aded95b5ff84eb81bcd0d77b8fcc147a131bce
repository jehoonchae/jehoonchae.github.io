John Jost 교수의 A Theory of System Justification을 읽고서.</p>

<p><em>As the French historical archaeologist Paul Veyne (1992) observed, “the tendency to justify what wxists constitutes one of the factors which combine to shape opinions” (p. 3)</em></p>

<p><em>Because it would be too painful to acknowledge that one is living in a state of injustice or exploitation, those who are disadvantaged may be motivated to distort and defend against certain realities by concluding that things are not really as bad as they seem. (p. 4)</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Dozens of social psychological experiments demonstrate that people are more likely to defend the social system following exposure to criticism of or threat to the social system, especially when it comes from an outsider—such as a foreign journalist or external enemy. (p. 7)*</li>
</ul>
