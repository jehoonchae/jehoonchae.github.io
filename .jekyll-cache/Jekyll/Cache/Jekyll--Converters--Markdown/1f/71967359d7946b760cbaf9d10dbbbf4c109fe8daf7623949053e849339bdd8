<p>rain</p>

<p>a symphony orchestra.<br />
there is a thunderstorm,<br />
they are playing a Wagner overture<br />
and the people leave their seats under the trees<br />
and run inside to the pavilion<br />
the women giggling, the men pretending calm,<br />
wet cigarettes being thrown away,<br />
Wagner plays on, and then they are all under the<br />
pavilion. the birds even come in from the trees<br />
and enter the pavilion and then it is the Hungarian<br />
Rhapsody #2 by Lizst, and it still rains, but look,<br />
one man sits alone in the rain<br />
listening. the audience notices him. they turn<br />
and look. the orchestra goes about its<br />
business. the man sits in the night in the rain,<br />
listening. there is something wrong with him,<br />
isnâ€™t there?<br />
he came to hear the<br />
music.</p>
