## Abstract

Abundant of scholarly works explored the corrective intervention on political misperception. While prior studies have focused on the effects of fact-checking news delivered by neutral third parties such as fact-check organizations, little is known as to the effect of fact-checking news delivered by partisan media. Against this background, we bring a focus on the case of South Korea, where legacy news organizations—including partisan media—are playing a leading role to produce the fact-checking news. Based on the frameworks of motivated reasoning and the hostile media effect, we investigate the corrective effect of fact-checking news—as well as perceived bias toward such news—when the fact-checking news is delivered by partisan media. Drawing on an original experiment conducted in South Korea, we confirm the corrective effects of fact-checking news even if such news is delivered by partisan media rather than neutral third parties. At the same time, we observed that perceived bias on the fact-checking news systematically varied as a function of the political slant of partisan media and the valence of the news, while the intensity of perceived bias increased as one’s ideological strength increased. It suggests that citizens indeed can adhere factual information based on correction messages despite their perpetual partisan biases, echoing several prior works on this topic. While we cannot definitely identify and confirm the precise nature of such mechanisms, it may further suggest that changes in one’s agreement or belief on misinformation not necessarily require corresponding changes in bias perception of the fact-checking news, suggesting the possibility of “attitudinal persuasion with perceptual backfire.”
