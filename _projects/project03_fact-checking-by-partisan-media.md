## Attitudinal Persuasion and Perceptual Backfire? Effects of Fact-Checking News Delivered by Partisan Media

Authors: Je Hoon Chae, Sang Yup Lee, & Hyunjin Song

### Abstract
---
The effectiveness of and its boundary conditions regarding fact-checking news exposure have significant normative and practical implications. While many of the prior studies have focused on the attitudinal consequences of fact-checking news delivered by neutral third parties such as fact-check organizations, relatively less is known as to the effect of fact-checking news delivered by partisan media. Based on the frameworks of motivated reasoning and the hostile media effect, we investigate the possibility of decoupling between *attitudinal* persuasion and *perceptual* backfire by fact-checking news by partisan mediaâ€”that is, exposure to fact-checking news increases bias perception of such news yet nevertheless attitudinally persuades audiences. Based on a series of original experiments conducted in South Korea and in the United States, we find consistent support for our prediction, in that exposure to fact-checking news produces the corrective effects, yet at the same time perceived bias of the fact-checking news systematically varies as a function of the ideological slant of partisan media.
