[**Perceiving Fact-Checks as Biased but Nevertheless Persuaded? Effects of Fact-Checking News Delivered by Partisan Media**](/projects/project03_fact-checking-by-partisan-media)

With [Hyunjin Song](https://www.hyunjinsong.com) & [Sang Yup Lee](https://sangyup-lee.github.io/aboutme/)

Does fact-checking news delivered by partisan media still have effectiveness? How do people perceive political bias of the fact-checking news by partisan media? With original experiment, we show that persuasive effect of fact-checking news by partisan media, even when it is perceived as biased favorably toward specific political ideology.

[**Event Segmentation in Memory for Real-World Social Events: A case study on COVID-19**](/projects/project02_event-segmentation)

With [Seokyoung Min](https://sites.google.com/view/seokyoungmin/home?authuser=0) & Sanghoon Han

How do we remember real-world events? Are event boundaries of memory for real-world events related to the pattern of media coverage? For the purpose, we compared individuals' common six event boundaries and news topics event boundaries segmented with Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We show that behavioral event boundaries in memory and data-driven HMM boundaries in news topics were significantly matched.

[**Image As Data: How Instagram photos reveal individualâ€™s characteristics and personality**](/projects/project01_image-as-data)

With [Seokyoung Min](https://sites.google.com/view/seokyoungmin/home?authuser=0), Jonghyun Lee, & [Sang Yup Lee](https://sangyup-lee.github.io/aboutme/)

Does photos uploaded on social media posts reveal one's personality? If so, how can we quantitatively (or computationally) measure and reveal the relationship empirically? Leveraging digital trace data (uploaded photos on Instagram) and surveys on Big-Five personality, our approach combining computational methods (computer vision API and topic modeling) and survey show that people with similar personalities upload similar photos.
